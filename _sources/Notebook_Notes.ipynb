    "##### * ssp370: refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) and represents the forced scenario until the year of 2100. The choice of the SSP3-7.0 scenario forcing follows CMIP6 recommendations (O’Neill et al., 2016) that precisely emphasize the value of this relatively high forcing level so as to quantify changes in natural variability (Rodgers et al. 2021). SSP3–7.0 lies between RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 and represents the medium to the high end of the range of future forcing pathways. \n",

    "##### * historical (1850 - 2014): not projected period, so ideal for doing validation of LENS2 with reanalysis or in situ data. Because of its spatial resolution and temporal extent, ERA5 can be used to do this validation. Considering the AMOC strength at 26.5N as an example {Fig. S2 in Rodgers et al. (2021)}, the ensemble mean AMOC strength for each of the micro-perturbation clusters initialized for years 1231 (strength), 1251 (decreasing), 1281 (increasing), and 1301 (weak) of the preindustrial control run (averaged across 20 members for each case) converge only after several decades, indicative of the timescale over which the initial condition memory persists for AMOC. For this reason, their analysis of internal variability focuses on the period after 1960, more than an entire century after initialization. How to know what is forced variability and natural variability? One way to check this is to differentiate between members of the same experiment."

The control experiment are the members who have the year 1191."
